# trickyunits_csharp

Some silly classes for C#

When I started this repository I was just fooling around with C# and I created these "units" in the process. Most of them just contain a few classes that I may use in a lot of my C# projects and which I don't wanna code again and again all over, and thus my projects will LINK to them. 

The name "units" goes back from the time that I truly learned to code when I was using Turbo Pascal, and back then I also had a unit collection like that, as that's how Pascal uses its own libraries. Although I've been using tons of other languages since then, the word "unit" stick with me somehow. ;)

Please note that some of these files may refer to other ones. When linking to these files, you may need to link to the files they link to as well. Some more elegant methods may come up if I can really find out how to do this properly in C# or visual studio. The safest way to make sure everything works in your program when using this is by linking to this entire folder. Of course, if you don't want your programs to become too big, you may wanna sort out what uses what.

Now the suffix "\_csharp" was only put in because I had to deal with other repositories already having the "trickyunits" name, so I needed to prevent conflicts. I have a special folder reserved for C# projects and there the folder "TrickyUnits" lives, and is also the folder serving as this repository.

UNLESS specifically stated otherwise in the class file all classes in this repository have been released under the zLib license.
